Threewave Capture Map Mods

To add capture support to the map the following entities must be added.
I usually just grab the entity list out of a bsp file (it's in there as
text) and hand edit it.  IMPULSE 99 with my code prints out your coordinates
and I use that for a guide as to where to put the flags and spawn codes.

As example, here's the extra section I added to e2m1:

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Capture the flag map mods
//

// team1

// This is team1's flag (gold key, usually red team)
{
"origin" "1800 416 244"
"classname" "item_flag_team1"
}

// Base spawns.  These are used at start of level and when someone
// joins.  They are not used for respawn, the regular deathmatch
// start spots are used.
{
"angle" "90"
"origin" "1736 410 248"
"classname" "info_player_team1"
}
{
"angle" "90"
"origin" "1836 410 248"
"classname" "info_player_team1"
}
{
"angle" "90"
"origin" "1736 490 248"
"classname" "info_player_team1"
}
{
"angle" "90"
"origin" "1836 490 248"
"classname" "info_player_team1"
}
{
"angle" "90"
"origin" "1736 570 248"
"classname" "info_player_team1"
}
{
"angle" "90"
"origin" "1836 570 248"
"classname" "info_player_team1"
}

// team2

// Team2 flag, sliver key usually for blue team
{
"origin" "-300 -25 -30"
"classname" "item_flag_team2"
}

// Team2 base spawns
{
"angle" "0"
"origin" "-142 82 -40"
"classname" "info_player_team2"
}
{
"angle" "0"
"origin" "-62 82 -40"
"classname" "info_player_team2"
}
{
"angle" "0"
"origin" "42 82 -40"
"classname" "info_player_team2"
}
{
"angle" "0"
"origin" "-142 162 -40"
"classname" "info_player_team2"
}
{
"angle" "0"
"origin" "-62 162 -40"
"classname" "info_player_team2"
}
{
"angle" "0"
"origin" "42 162 -40"
